## Hi there

I am an A-level student based in Middlesbrough, UK, studying **Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science**, with predicted grades of **3 A***s. I am particularly focused on software development and spend a significant amount of my time building and refining real-world projects outside of my academic studies.

I am currently seeking **part-time voluntary software development experience**, with increased availability during holidays, in order to gain exposure to a professional development environment and continue developing my technical skills.
