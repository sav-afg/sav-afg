## Hi there 👋

I am an A-level student based in Middlesbrough, UK, studying **Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science**, with predicted grades of 3 A\*s. I am particularly focused on software development and spend much of my time building and improving real-world projects outside of my studies.

I am currently seeking **part-time voluntary software development experience**, with increased availability during holidays, to gain exposure to a professional development environment and continue developing my technical skills.
